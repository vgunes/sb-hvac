% Use Simulink Project API to get the current project:
p = slproject.getCurrentProject;

% Get the project root folder:
projectRoot = p.RootFolder;

% Remove paths added for this project. Get the single definition of the
% folders to add to the path:
folders = project_paths();

% Remove these from the MATLAB path:
for jj=1:numel(folders)
    rmpath( fullfile(projectRoot, folders{jj}) );
end

% Reset the location where generated code and other temporary files are
% created (slprj) to the default:
Simulink.fileGenControl('reset');
